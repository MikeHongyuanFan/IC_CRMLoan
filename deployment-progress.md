# CRM Loan System Deployment Progress

## Summary
We've made significant progress in setting up the deployment infrastructure for the CRM Loan System. The system now has proper scripts for building and deploying both backend and frontend components using Docker.

## Completed Tasks

### Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Created `setup-docker.sh` to prepare the Docker environment
- ✅ Created `docker-compose.yml` with proper configuration for all services
- ✅ Set up networking between containers
- ✅ Configured volume persistence for MySQL data

### Backend Build Process
- ✅ Fixed Maven repository issues by switching from Aliyun to Maven Central
- ✅ Added retry logic to handle temporary network failures
- ✅ Fixed Dockerfile paths for backend services
- ✅ Implemented proper JAR file copying from build container

### Frontend Build Process
- ✅ Fixed Python dependency issues in Node.js containers
- ✅ Added necessary build tools (make, g++) to frontend containers
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling and cleanup

### Deployment Scripts
- ✅ Created `deploy-local.sh` with clean deployment option
- ✅ Created `cleanup.sh` for removing existing containers
- ✅ Added progress feedback during long-running operations
- ✅ Implemented proper error handling throughout the process

## Next Steps

### Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test complete end-to-end deployment
- [ ] Verify all services start correctly
- [ ] Validate frontend applications are accessible
- [ ] Check backend API functionality

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] Add health checks to Docker Compose configuration
- [ ] Implement database initialization scripts
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging solutions
- [ ] Create backup and restore procedures

## Issues Resolved

1. **Container Conflict Issues**
   - Fixed by adding cleanup logic to remove existing containers before starting new ones

2. **Frontend Build Failures**
   - Resolved by adding Python and build tools to Node.js containers

3. **Maven Repository Issues**
   - Fixed by switching from Aliyun to Maven Central repository
   - Added retry logic to handle temporary network failures

4. **Docker Build Path Issues**
   - Corrected file paths in Dockerfiles
   - Updated Docker Compose configuration to use proper build contexts

## Conclusion
The deployment infrastructure is now much more robust and should work reliably. The next step is to perform a complete deployment test to verify all components work together correctly.
